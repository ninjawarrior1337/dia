Hahaha new project for me to drop support for in a few months, or maybe not who knows...
I mean we are in quarantine, and I have nothing better to do.

Lambda functions (I wanted something similar to PHP) must implement the HandleFunc
interface and be put in a file named ```*.lambda```
there is currently no support for external packages until 
[containous/yaegi](https://github.com/containous/yaegi) 
allows for it. But Go's standard library is pretty 
powerful, so I don't think you will need it.
